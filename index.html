			<h2>Statements:</h2>
			<p>The bisector of vertex &angle; in an isos. (&#9651;) bisects &amp; is (&perp;) to base</p>
			<p>Diags. of rect. are = &rightarrow; If a (&#9649;) has = diags. it is a rect.</p>
			<p>A rhombus' diag. bisect &angle;s &amp; are (&perp;) to each other</p>
			<p>In an isos. trap. 2 legs make = &angle;s w/ either base (p102, #9)</p>
			<p>The mid-pt. of hypotenuse of any rt. (&#9651;) is same dist. from 3 vertices (p102, #4)</p>
			<p>The diag. of an isos. trap. are = (p102, #10)</p>

			<h2>Principles</h2>
			<p>1 &rightarrow; A st. line is shortest line btw 2pts.</p>
			<p>2 &rightarrow; Only 1 st. line can be drawn btw 2pts.</p>
			<p>3 &rightarrow; = quantities = to same quantity are = to each other</p>
			<p>4 &rightarrow; 2 st. lines intersect at only 1 pt.</p>
			<p>5 &rightarrow; The whole is = to (&Sigma;) its parts</p>
			<p>6 &rightarrow; The whole is &gt; any of its parts</p>
			<p>7 &rightarrow; ='s + ='s are =</p>
			<p>8 &rightarrow; ='s - ='s are =</p>
			<p>9 &rightarrow; 2x of ='s are =</p>
			<p>10 &rightarrow; Halves of ='s are =</p>
